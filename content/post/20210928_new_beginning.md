Just saw this article: [How Writing Can Help Us With Grief and Trauma](https://every.to/the-long-conversation/the-journal-is-a-mind-expanding-agent) from [Sustainable Productivity](https://letters.acacess.com/). Before I even finished reading, I decided to try to write something everyday. So I spent two hours tonight before night, setup a new github account and a new github page site.

I am almost 40 years old now, everyday I am struggling to keep up to the expectation from everywhere. There is a lot of time I feel no motivation to do anything when I am looking at my long todo list.

I think writing down my thoughts and maybe improve my english writing skill at the same time (even slowly) is Two birds with one stone.
