It has been 7 days since my parents are locked in their apartment. Some of my collegemates have been locked down for even longer time. Yet they seem not so worried about the situation. I don't know is it because of me being weird or they don't see what the worst might come. Some of my friends even think everything is ok while the fact there are so many people are starving, it's really hard to understand that.
