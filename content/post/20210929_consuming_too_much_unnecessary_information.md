A lot of time when I feel "exhausted", I will open one app(could be NGA, Douban, Twitter or Telegram) in my iPhone, and keep refreshing screen by pulling down in the next 1-2 hours. I thought there might be some "useful" information in those Apps I won't want to miss. Sometimes I run out of all the contents I can refresh from one APP, I will then switch to another APP and continue doing same thing. I call this activity "consuming too much unncessary information", this is what it is. Most of time I didn't get any "necessary" information out of it, even when I do get something, because the shallow browsing, those links are just ended up in some of my Read Later services.  

This activity is supposed to relax myself, after all that's the default activity I would reward myself when I finished some hard work. But unfortunately, 99.99% time, this kind of activity made me feel worse, make me feel empty and even guilty, so guilty that I would have trouble falling sleep. Because I feel I wasted a lot of time that day, and I regret too much to be calm enough to fall asleep.

I tried to set up some rules to prevent myself falling that trap again and again. For example, setup screen time in iPhone for certain APPs. But a lot of time I found myself just click "ignore for today" without thinking more than one second. Another thing I tried is use "Forest.app", that helps a lot during the day time when I have a lot of work to do. But in the evening, especially before go to sleep, there is no way I am going to having my iPhone put aside planting a tree without "relaxing" myself first.

So far the most successful method worked for me is mindfulness, actually realizing what I am doing, show myself what the consequences will be. It never ends up good.

So I am still fighting this desire everyday. Trying to limit this kind of activity with less than 1 hour each day. Hopefully I can save a lot of time to do some other "necessary" things.
